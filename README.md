# PySpark_Primer
A resource for introducing PySpark to my coworkers. 
I've found in numerous professional spaces the need to introduce others to common tasks in PySpark.

This repository is a document to store the most useful PySpark SQL Functions that I've found myself returning to. 
Much of this work was originally developed in Databricks*, but it has been converted to work in Github Codespaces.

Open the `Primer.ipynb` file to review this example code that I have put together. 

**This includes a brief description of Databricks features as well since that is the platform I'm most familiar with.*
